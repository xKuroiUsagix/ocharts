## OCharts
The idea of this project is to create a platform where osu! players can find beatmaps and packs using tags and various filters. Tags will be manually added by players and verified by moderators (which is just me for now -_-).

For each song completed, users will receive 5 Chart Coins (name and amount subject to change). Coins will be used for leaderboard purposes for now. In the future, if things go well, we could consider adding prizes.

Users can create their own packs. Packs can be liked, and saved to bookmarks. (In future will be adding ability to donwload entire pack with one click, but for now it won't be implemented)
